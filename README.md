This is a platform where software engineers/developers can create their profile and showcase their porjects. They also can communicate with each other via commenting and chatting. Developers can also find other developers using search functionality. The core technology behind the project is Python, Django, REST api, HTML, CSS. Little bit of Javescript is also applied except the framework/library used. This project helped me learning different features of Django like models, authentication, messages, signals, views, templates, static files, media, api creation and so on. This is an ongoing project and I am still adding different features in different time.
